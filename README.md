> Auto-Differentiable Constrained and Unconstrained Finite Strip Method

This repository contains a port of the original CUFSM package, primarily developed by Dr. Benjamin W. Schafer, from MATLAB to Julia. This port enables users to perform automatic differentiation through any part of its code, facilitating the optimization of cold-formed steel section topologies for strength, stiffness, and other desired parameters.
